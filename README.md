# Customer-Churn-Analysis

## About the Dataset:
- The dataset has information about telecom customers, the dataset has info about both types of customers (ones who churn, ones who do not). 
- Each row represents a customer, and each column has particular features for each customer.
- The target variable for us is the **Churn** column, which tells us whether or not the customer has churned.
- Columns convey information about:
    1. Demographic information such as gender, age, whether or not they have dependents, and/or partners.
    2. Services each customer is using, such as phone, multiple lines, internet service, etc.
    3. Account information has data about the tenure of the customer, contract type, payment methods, monthly and total charges, etc.
- The dataset can be accessed through this link directing to Kaggle: [WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/palashfendarkar/wa-fnusec-telcocustomerchurn)

## Goal of the Analysis:
In this project, I will analyze customer churn data from a telecommunications company to uncover the key factors that contribute to customer attrition. Through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), I will examine customer demographics, service subscriptions, and account-related information to identify patterns and trends related to churn.

I will also create visualizations to better understand the distribution of variables and their relationships with churn behavior. Based on these insights, I will engineer relevant features and develop a predictive model using logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of future customer churn. 

The ultimate objective is to build a data-driven understanding that can help improve customer retention strategies.
